                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Over the last 5 years, I have had experience leading teams of over 300 and teams of 30. Leadership and team development are my passion. I love seeing team members take steps to become leaders in their fields and take pride in mentoring and developing the next generation. Although I’m young, I promise you I haven’t wasted my years. I’ve spent 4 years learning leadership on an international scale in one of the largest organizations on the planet, and I know the importance of building and maintaining culture and creating a team-first work environment. I hope to have the opportunity to work with you!</p>
